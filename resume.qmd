I am currently a junior at California State University Channel Islands. I am a computer science major with a string interest in the cybersecurity field. 

I work full time at H&M in Santa Barabara, I plan on tutoring next semester at CSUCI. I am currently open to any internship opportunities in the computer science/cybersecurity/engineering field. 

I am not currently working on any projects.
